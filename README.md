## R for HTA 2021: Fantastic Data and Where to Scrape Them

**Repository for the presentation by Fanny Franchini at the online R for HTA 2021 conference**

### üìñ Abstract

This repository is associated with the *Fantastic Data and Where to Scrape Them* presentation at the *R for HTA 2021* meeting by Fanny Franchini.   
*Please note that this presentation is aimed at beginners*  
  
Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and Health Economic (HE) analyses rely partly on the data hosted across multiple websites curated by different governmental bodies. As a result, there is no unified repository containing all the information necessary for data mining and subsequent analyses.   
  
Web scraping is a technique that performs automated information extraction from websites. Scrapers work by parsing the page source code to retrieve programmatically specified elements. This workshop aims to introduce participants to scraping in R, for HTML-based websites.   
  
In the case study presented, we scrape the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme website to produce a structured dataframe containing all drugs listed by the Australian TGA and their restriction of use, doses, current unit cost as well as historical cost.

### üîç What is in here?  

The repository contains **two R scripts**. 

1. The first one `pbs_scraper.R` is the script used for this case-study, i.e. scraping the PBS.
2. The second one `function_scraper.R` is the script containing the functions that are used in 1.
